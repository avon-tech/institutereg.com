            <p>
            Several Nobel Prizes have been awarded for the original and subsequent discoveries related to stem cells. This is perhaps medicine’s most promising area for anti-aging and life extension, along with possible human treatments. That said, this area is full of controversy and confusion due to the proliferation of products and claims.
            </p>
            <p>
            An entire hierarchy of stem cells and their chemical products for regeneration needs to be understood to match properly a type of preparation for an intended clinical use. Claims can be made that suggest a person is getting stem cells that will integrate in their tissues as new youthful cells, and depending on the product and preparation there may be no living cells, nor cells that are either youthful or integrate in tissue. With a full understanding of what is offered for what purpose, an optimal match between the product or procedure and the intended use can be made.
            </p>
            <p>              
            Regeneration medicine protocols can be broadly divided between cellular and growth factor protocols. A cellular procedure provides living cells that in some cases may incorporate in tissue, or may primarily be a source of growth and regeneratiaon chemical factors that effect the intended results.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            There’s a hierarchy of types and functions of stem cells that is complex and multifactorial that contributes to confusion in this area if not understood. The most powerful of all the stem cells are true embryonic stem cells. These are from the early stage forming embryo and are so dynamic they are called totipotent. This means that a single cell can create an entire new person. That’s an incredible amount of power and can be too powerful. This is the only type of stem cell prone to form benign tumors called teratomas. These can be giant hair balls in the abdomen or elsewhere, as big as a cantaloupe, with hair and skin and teeth and nails and any other body tissue rolled into a mass. This is the main reason that the use of these cells is avoided, until such time this tendency can be securely prevented.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            The next most powerful type of stem cell, that is by contrast also safe to use, is called pluripotent. Pluri means many and a pluripotent cell is capable of becoming any type of cell in the body.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            In the early embryo the cells segment into 3 distinct germ layers - ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm - each of which gives rise to particular cells and tissues in the ultimate newly formed body. Pluripotent stem cells can become any of the types of cells of any of the 3 germ layers, making them very broadly useful for regeneration medicine.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            A pluripotent stem cell with extraordinary features is the so called VSEL, which stands for "very small embryonic-like" stem cell. The very important key is that these cells are embryonic-like, which means quite powerful, yet they are just past the embryonic stage and have been shown to be not prone to teratoma formation. This makes them the most potent cell that can thus far be used for general regeneration medicine. Depending upon the conditions in which they are cultured they have been conclusively proven to be able to generate cells of all 3 germ layers.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            What is even more remarkable is that at or around the time we are born these cells go into a state of hibernation. They become dormant and are not dividing, which also means they are effectively not aging. Telomeres, the ends of the chromosomes that get smaller with cell replication, the core DNA aging clock, remain very long like those of newborn or very young cells. Whether someone is 5 or 50 or 100 years old these cells retain the energy and function of newborn caliber cells, as if the person had saved their umbilical cord blood throughout life.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            While powerful these cells are not useful if they are dormant. What a research group has accomplished and published in the <a href="https://www.cellr4.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/12/e2990.pdf" target="_blank">Manchester Paper</a> is a method of rapidly awakening these cells from dormancy.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            Cell counts in peripheral blood, from which these cells are derived by a simple blood draw of 60-90 ml for a regeneration medicine session, are reported at only 80-1300 cells per ml of blood. While these cells are powerful such counts are not sufficient for a remarkable anti-aging effect. When we apply this patented and proprietary method of laser based photoacoustic resonance we stimulate the cells to express the surface proteins that allows them to be counted and the measured numbers increase to as many half a million cells per ml or more.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            The cells have also become metabolically awakened and active. This number of functional freshly activated cells is sufficient for significant anti-aging effects from head to toe. These discoveries and cell counts are the cardinal features reported in the Manchester Paper.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            Another significant aspect of the applied photoacoustic resonance technology is the ability to send a 3-dimensional homing signal through tissue to direct the stem cells where to go in tissue to concentrate and regenerate. This is unique technology in the stem cell therapy world that allows us to increase the probability that a stem cell goes to where it’s most needed in the body. This application is protected through the recently granted US patent 10,202,598 which includes the accepted claim of directing the 3 dimensional localization of a stem cell in tissue by using a modulated laser from at least 2 directions. The acoustic vibrational signature transmitted deeply through tissue in essence gives the command sequence of "go there, stay there, and repair there." Unless a stem cell actually goes where it is desired, remains there and becomes what is needed, the cell will not be providing the highest level of regeneration possible.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            The small size of these cells at a diameter of 1-4 microns (a micron being a thousandth of a millimeter) is vitally important. When cells are injected intravenously (IV) the first place they go is to the right side of the heart, then the pulmonary arteries, and then through the lungs. The diameter of the lung capillaries, though tiny at about 6 microns, are wide enough to allow these cells to pass easily and go everywhere throughout the body. This includes the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and enter the brain and spinal cord, which are tissues that are often difficult for stem cells to access. When combined with photoacoustic guidance through tissue we have often observed neurological reconnections within a few hours.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            When used to enhance the structure and function of the heart, there has usually been at least a 15 percent increase in function, an average of about 50 percent increase, and some cases with a 100 percent or more increase in function with a single IV treatment. This contrasts with a review article that combined results from multiple published studies that injected other types of stem cells directly into the coronary arteries of the heart (or the heart muscle) that resulted in only an average 8 percent increase in function.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            The freshly awakened VSELs can be injected directly into a joint and then the photoacoustic process used to promote adhesion of the V cells to the cartilage surfaces lining the joint. Even though the cells are already in the desired tissue space an added instruction signal for cell adherence accelerates the enhancement of structure and function of the joint.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            When the cells are given IV, the photoacoustic process increases the probability that cells will go to the most desired locations as guided, yet many cells will also distribute randomly throughout the body. In addition to the directed regeneration effects, there can thus also be head to toe anti-aging effects. Among the cells randomly distributing, any areas of inflammation will tend to draw more cells to support the healthy structure and functiaon of such stressed tissues.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            As these cells are a perfect match for the person there are no risks of rejection or other adverse immunologic reactions such as the cells attacking the host. Once a VSEL has attached to the new tissue it will be given instructions by cell to cell communication to become exactly the type of cell needed by that tissue. The newly differentiated V cells have the long telomeres of newborn caliber cells that generate new tissue so youthful the tissue aging clock can be reset at younger levels. Thus there can be an augmented regeneration effect where the cells are specifically directed and general anti-aging effects everywhere else throughout the body. For versatility and utility, VSELs are a generally good option for persons of any age.
            </p> 
            <p>              
            This program is further enhanced by a general and also specific nutritional support system. There are nutrients that have been shown to have powerful anti-aging or stem cell stimulating effects which are provided as part of the overall rejuvenation protocol. In addition, other targeted formulas may be provided depending on particular body systems that may need additional metabolic support for optimum regeneration of structure and function. Other levels and layers of advanced technology may be added with the intention of getting the best possible results for a given individual.
